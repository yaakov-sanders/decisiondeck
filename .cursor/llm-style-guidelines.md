# LLM Style Guidelines

## CSS and Styling

- **Always use CSS classnames for styling components instead of hardcoded inline styles whenever possible.**
- Define and use CSS classes in external `.css` or `.scss` files for all reusable or shared styles.
- Inline styles should only be used for dynamic, one-off, or computed values that cannot be easily expressed with a class.
- This ensures maintainability, theming, and consistency across the codebase.
